Hi, I'm Alex and I have an education in materials science, organic electronics and microfabrication.
However, I also have a keen interest in data science and am interested in getting into the field.
I'm using Github right now to host personal projects, which currently is an ANN made in tensorflow and jupyter to decide which of two NBA players is better based on selected stats.
Feel free to talk to me about anything!
